An automation script that I developed at work, which cut down excel sheet processing time from 30-45 minutes to about 30 seconds.

An unedited excel sheet would have to be processed manually to get a set of calculated values, which would be uploaded to Power BI for data
visualization purposes.

The original excel sheet would contain various unncecessary data. The columns also had to be modified in a specific manner to do the 
calculate the results.
